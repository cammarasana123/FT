# **Test description**

We provide an analysis of the truncation of the spectrum. We show that the PSNR value computed between the ground-truth image and the denoised image increases up to a certain truncation value, and then decreases. Through this experimental approach, we can identify the best truncation value.

For both Gaussian and speckle noise, we report the ground-truth (GT) and noisy images, the denoised images with different truncation values, and the PSNR plot with respect to the truncation threshold value.
